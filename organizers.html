							<p>
								Yulia Sandamirskaya is a Group Leader in the Institute of Neuroinformatics (INI) at the University of Zurich and ETH
								Zurich.  Her group “Neuromorphic Cognitive Robots” develops neuro-dynamic architectures for embodied cognitive agents.
								In particular, she studies memory formation, motor control, and autonomous learning in spiking and continuous neural
								networks, realised in neuromorphic hardware interfaced to robotic sensors and motors.  She has a degree in Physics from
								the Belorussian State University in Minsk, Belarus and Dr.  rer. nat. from the Institute for Neural Computation in
								Bochum, Germany.  She is the chair of EUCOG — the European Society for Cognitive Systems and the coordinator of the
								NEUROTECH project that supports and develops the neuromorphic computing community in Europe.

                               Mohsen Kaboli is an IEEE senior member and senior research scientist in robotics, visio-tactile intelligence, and machine learning at the BMW research department in Germany.
                               Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral research associate and Hans-Fisher fellow at the institute for advanced study (IAS) at the Technical University of Munich.
                               He was awarded a Ph.D. degree in robotics and tactile intelligence with the highest distinction (summa cum laude) from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2017.
                               He was a finalist for the 2018 Georges Giralt Ph.D. The award for the best robotics Ph.D. thesis in Europe.

								Nicolai Waniek is a research scientist at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Renningen, Germany, where
								he currently works on manipulation robotics and visual perception. He has a particular interest in the
								theory and algorithms of spiking neural networks and higher cortical computations, distributed message
								passed systems, and self-organization in dynamical systems.  Before joining Bosch he was with the
								Neuroscientific System Theory, TU Munich, Germany. There, he conducted research on rodent spatial navigation
								and memory, neuro-robotics, event-based vision, and developed a novel model for place and grid cells. He
								holds a Diploma in Computer Science from Ulm University, and received the Dr.rer.nat. from TU Munich. He's
								also trained as a professional software developer.

                                Jörg Conradt is an Associate Professor at Computational Science and Technology, KTH, Stockholm.
                                Understanding and applying the computational principles behind how brains turn perception into behavior is one of the most challenging research questions for the upcoming decades.
                                His research investigates theory, models, and implementations of distributed neuronal information processing, to (a) discover key principles by which large networks of neurons operate and to (b) implement those in engineered systems to enhance their real-world and real-time performance.
                                He holds an M.S. degree in Computer Science/Robotics from the University of Southern California, a Diploma in Computer Engineering from TU Berlin, and a Ph.D. in Physics/Neuroscience from ETH Zurich.
